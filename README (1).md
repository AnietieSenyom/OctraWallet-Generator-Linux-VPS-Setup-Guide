# 🔐 Octra Wallet Generator — Linux VPS Setup Guide

A secure and efficient way to generate Octra wallets directly from your own VPS.  
This guide walks you through setting up and running the **Octra Wallet Generator v4** using the **pre-built Linux binary**, with persistent background sessions using `screen`.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Ensure the following tools are installed on your VPS:

- `wget` – for downloading files  
- `tar` – for extracting `.tar.gz` archives  
- `screen` – to keep the generator running in the background

Install them with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wget tar screen
```

---

## 🖥️ Start a Persistent Screen Session

Start a `screen` session to keep the wallet generator alive even after disconnection:

```bash
screen -S octa
```

You’ll be dropped into a new terminal window inside the screen session.

> To detach: `Ctrl + A`, then `D`  
> To reattach:  
```bash
screen -r octa
```  
> To exit and stop: type `exit` inside the screen

sudo ufw reload
```

**For iptables users:**

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8888 -j ACCEPT
